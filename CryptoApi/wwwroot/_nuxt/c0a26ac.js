Cookies set by parties other than the website operator are called "third party cookies". The parties that set third party cookies can recognize your web browser both when it visits the LetsExChange’s website and when it visits certain other websites where the third party’s cookies are also present.\nCookies protection is regulated by Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002 (ePrivacy Directive).\n'},{title:"Use Cookies",text:"When you access our websites, we or companies we work with may place cookies on your computer or other device.

They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. These also include cookies we may rely on for fraud prevention. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.\nPerformance/Analytics Cookies\nThese cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our websites. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.\nFunctionality Cookies\nThese cookies allow us to remember the choices you make and to tailor our Services so we can provide relevant content to you. For example, a functionality cookie can remember your preferences (e.g., country or language selection), or your username.\nTargeting/Advertising Cookies\nLetsExChange uses third party service providers to display advertising on our Services and serve advertising on other third party sites that may be relevant to you or your interests. These cookies are also used to help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers. This means that after you have been to our websites, you may see some advertisements about our Services elsewhere on the Internet. The information collected through this process by the third party service providers does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you unless you choose to provide these. Such advertising will only be delivered where permitted by applicable law. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less advertising tailored to your inferred interests on our websites and will not receive targeted LetsExChange advertisements on third party websites.\n"},{title:"Enable, disable or delete cookies",text:'You can also use the browser with which you are viewing this website to enable, disable or delete cookies.

Many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which maintain websites where individuals can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To opt-out of website interest-based advertising provided by each organization’s respective participating companies, visit the DAA’s opt-out portal available at <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/"><span>http://optout.aboutads.info/</span></a>, the DAA of Canada’s opt-out portal available at <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools"><span>https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools</span></a>, or visit the NAI’s opt-out portal available at <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1"><span>http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1</span></a>. Residents of the European Union may opt-out of online behavioral advertising served by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s participating member organizations by visiting <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/"><span>https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</span></a>.\nMobile Advertising: You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of advertising by accessing the appropriate settings in your mobile device and following the instructions. If you opt-out, we will remove all data about you and will not collect any further data. The random ID previously assigned to you will be removed. Thus, if at a later stage, you decide to opt-in, we will be unable to continue and track you using the prior ID and you will for all practical purposes be a new user. For iOS devices, to limit interest-based ad tracking, go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Turn on “Limit Ad Tracking.” For Android devices, go to Settings > Google services > Ads > Turn on “Opt out of Ads Personalization." For iOS and Android, you can also reset the advertising identifier that is currently assigned to you.\nDo Not Track: Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" or "DNT" signals. Since uniform standards for "DNT" signals have not been adopted, our websites do not currently process or respond to "DNT" signals.\nThe length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie.

Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted.\n'},{title:"Update this Cookie Policy",text:"We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
