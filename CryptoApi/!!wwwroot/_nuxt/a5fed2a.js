Standard Procedure for Customer Identification and Verification",text:"2.1. The company has automatic risk-management system that helps the company to identify suspicious transactions. \nThe company has right to identify its customers who wants to use the company’s services on the basis of an identity (especially if the transaction seems to be suspicious). \n2.2. If the customer is a private individual, the company has the right to ask he or she to provide: \n2.2.1.  full name; \n2.2.2.  personal identification code or, if none, the date of birth and the place of residence, the address, the bank details, the mobile phone number;      \n2.2.3.  if the customer is in fact representing another private individual being the real customer (under a power of attorney, or in the case of inheritance, or any other way) information on the identification and verification of the right of representation and scope thereof and, where the right of representation does not arise from law, the name of the document serving as the basis for the right of representation, the date of issue, and the name of the issuer; \n2.2.4. whether the customer is a politically exposed person (PEP), a family member of a PEP or a person known to be a close associate with a PEP.\n2.2.5. Please note that if a person is identified as PEP, the company reserves the right to refuse to open an account and conduct any transactions to such a person.\n2.3. The company may ask the following valid documents serve as basis for identification: \n2.3.1.  an identity card; \n2.3.2.  a passport; \n2.3.3.  a diplomatic passport; \n2.3.4.  a driving license if the document shows the name, photo or image, signature or signature image and date of birth or personal identification code of its holder;\n2.3.5. image or photo of you. Valid photo: you must provide a photograph showing you holding your identity document in front of your chest.\n2.3.6. video including information page of your identification cards.\n2.4.

The documents mentioned in the section 2.10. may serve as basis for the identification of \nthe legal entity. \n2.6. In identifying a person, company may check the validity of the identity document, make sure the person matches the information on the document and check the age of the person. If in doubt about the identity of the person, company may request additional information about the person or request for the additional actions (such as making selfie or screen of the wallet, or making test transaction). Upon sending a document that does not match the person or is invalid, company must refuse the customers’ transaction. If the customer refuses provide the documents upon the company’s request, the company has right to refuse the customers’ transaction. \n2.7. The company has the right to verify the correctness of the customer data, using information originating from a credible and independent source for that purpose. Where the identified person has a valid document specified in the section 2.3. or an equivalent document, the person is identified and the person’s identity is verified on the basis of the document or using means of electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, and the validity of the document appears from the document, or can be identified using means of electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, no additional details on the document need to be retained. \n2.8. The company has the right to identify the beneficial owners (UBOs)* and, for the purpose of verifying their identities, taking measures to the extent that allows the company to make certain that he/she knows who the beneficial owners are, and understands the ownership and control structure of the customer, or of the person participating in the transaction. \n*Ultimate beneficial owner (UBO) refers to the natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls a customer and/or the natural person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. It also includes those persons who exercise ultimate effective control over a legal entity or arrangement. Reference to “ultimately owns or controls” and “ultimate effective control” refer to situations in which ownership/control is exercised through a chain of ownership or by means of control other than direct control. This definition should also apply to beneficial owner or a beneficiary under a life or other investment linked insurance policy. An UBO is a private individual owning or controlling more than 25% of a legal entity. \n2.9. The company verifies the correctness of the information of a legal entity, using the information originating from a credible and independent source for that purpose. When company is able to verify the information through such direct access, the submission of the documents specified in section 2.10. does not need to be demanded from the customer. \n2.10. If the customer is a legal entity (for example a company), the company has the right to ask it to provide in addition to the information in sections 2.4. and 2.8., a Commercial Registry (or Company House or similar, depending of the country of origin) extract for the legal entity authenticated by a public notary and/or legalized and/or certified with an apostille, unless otherwise provided for in an international agreement also showing the rights of representation for that legal entity. \n2.11. A representative of a legal person must, at the request of company, for example when the right of representation does not appear in the submitted documents, submit a document certifying his or her powers (a power of attorney), which has been authenticated by a public notary and/or legalized and/or certified with an apostille, unless otherwise provided for in an international agreement. \n2.12. The company may ask additional information about the customer in case of any suspicion about the customer’s identity information or the customer’s behavior. Such additional information asked should be relevant to the raised risks which, when obtained, may prove that the risks are in fact explainable. \n2.13. The company can also collect information about customers email address, phone number and date of birth and add this to the customer KYC file. \n2.14. The company may cross-check the customer through the internal and external databases of device fingerprints, address, name, e-mail, ID code and all other data that is available in order to detect double registrations or multiple accounts of the customer. \n2.15 The company may cross-check the customer through appropriate sanctions lists including but not limited to: \nOFAC SDN \nUnited Nations Security Council Sanctions List \nWorld Bank - Ineligible Firms And Individuals List \nEU - Financial Sanctions List \nUK - HMT Financial Sanctions List \nAU - DFAT Consolidated Sanction List \nUS - Bureau Of Industry And Security List \nCH - SECO Sanction List \nUS - Department Of State Nonproliferation Sanctions List \nInterpol Wanted List \n"},{title:"3.
